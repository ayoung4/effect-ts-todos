# Getting Started with EffectTs Todos

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Uses effect-ts to sequence loading/saving redux state and rendering a react/redux app

Uses the effect-ts adaptation of morphic-ts to compose business objects that come with constructors, destructors, guards, validators and typesafe reducer factory functions (you can use the original @morphic-ts/batteries to accomplish the same things)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
